 Smart Home System – CENG 464

 Project Description
This project is a simple Smart Home System implemented in C++.
It demonstrates the use of **Design Patterns**, specifically the
**Factory Method pattern**, as required in the course project.

 My Responsibility
**Add Device – Factory Method Pattern**

I implemented the Add Device functionality using the Factory Method pattern.
The system can create different device types dynamically based on user input.

Supported devices:
- Light
- Camera
- TV

 How It Works
The program asks the user:
1. How many devices to add
2. Which device type (L = Light, C = Camera, T = TV)

Then devices are created using `DeviceFactory` and printed to the screen.

 How to Run
- Open the project in **Dev-C++**
- Compile and Run (F11)
- Follow the console instructions
